# About-Me

My name is Benjamin Barnhill, I am a full-stack developer from Memphis, TN. I graduated in 2019 from the University of Tennessee with a degree in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in mathematics, as science and math are two of my biggest passions. I enjoy the creative problem-solving and puzzle-like nature of coding, which is what drew me to the profession to begin with, and I am excited for the opportunities that this profession will give me. My interest in coding was initially sparked by learning Python during the pandemic, where I learned the basics of data manipulation and web scraping. After undergoing the training regiment provided by Revature, I have expanded my knowledge of coding by learning the necessary technologies for full-stack development, such as Java, Angular 2+, and AWS microservices. The ability to link and connect all these technologies is also a vital aspect of the full-stack development process that I've learned from Revature, something which was aided by my former work in group engineering projects during my time at university. Revature has also given me the opportunity to work on projects with my fellow software engineers to develop publicly-hosted full-stack web applications, which allowed me to further develop my communication skills and acclimated me to working within an Agile environment with industry-standard practices.
