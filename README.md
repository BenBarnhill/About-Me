# About-Me

My name is Benjamin Barnhill, I am a full-stack developer from Memphis, TN. I graduated in 2019 from the University of Tennessee with a degree in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in mathematics, as science and math are two of my biggest passions. I enjoy the creative problem-solving and puzzle-like nature of coding, which is what drew me to the profession to begin with, and I am excited for the opportunities that this profession will give me. When I'm not coding or working on personal projects, I enjoy reading and tabletop boardgames. I also have a passion for learning languages, not just coding languages but spoken ones. I am currently fluent in Spanish and English and am currently learning Arabic and Catalan.
